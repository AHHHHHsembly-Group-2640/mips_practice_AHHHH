#   Task 1: User Input and Output
#   In this task, you will practice getting user input, moving them to registers, and printing them back to the user. Below are the specific requirements for this task:
#       A. Use "main: " label for this task
#       B. Get 2 int values from the user
#       C. The two user values should be held in registers $s0 and $s1, respectively
#       D. Output the user inputs in the "Run I/O" section in MARS environment back to the user

data:
    #create variables here?

text:
    main:
        #get user input, store in $s0 and $s1


#   Task 2: Arithmetic Operation Practice
#   Using the user input values in registers $s0 and $s1, write MIPS Assembly code to complete the arithmetic operations below:
#       A. add two values (use instruction "add")
#       B. subtract two values (use instruction "sub")
#       C. multiply two values (use instruction "mul")
#       D. divide two values (use instruction "div")
#       E. Output the arithmetic results in the "Run I/O" section in MARS environment back to the user


#   Task 3: Conditions
#   In this final task, you will practice how to do conditions in Assembly:
#       A. If the two user inputs from Task 1 are equal to each other, output "User inputs are the same"
#       B. If the two user inputs from Task 1 are not equal to each other, output "User inputs are different"
